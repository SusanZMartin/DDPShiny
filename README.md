# DDPShiny
This repository contains the ui.R and server.R files for my shiny app created for the Developing Data Products course (April 2015). Note however that the repo contains only those two files and not the ancillary files (HTML files for example) needed to run the shiny app (since these are on the shiny.io site it didn't seem necessary).
